# 🚀 START HERE - Deploy Your PDF Merger in Docker

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Fix Docker First

Your Docker daemon is not running. Follow these steps:

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP ACTION PLAN

### STEP 1: Fix Docker Desktop (Required First)

#### Option A: Quick Restart (Try This First)
1. **Right-click** the Docker Desktop icon in your system tray (bottom-right corner)
2. Click **"Quit Docker Desktop"**
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. **Start Docker Desktop** from Start Menu
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for it to fully start (icon should stop animating)

#### Option B: If Restart Doesn't Work
1. **Right-click** `fix-docker.bat`
2. Select **"Run as administrator"**
3. Follow the instructions

#### Option C: Install/Update WSL2 (If needed)
Open PowerShell as **Administrator** and run:
```powershell
wsl --install
wsl --update
wsl --set-default-version 2
```
**Then restart your computer.**

---

### STEP 2: Verify Docker is Working

Open PowerShell and run:
```bash
docker ps
```

**If you see a list (even if empty) or no errors = Docker is working! ✅**

**If you see an error = Go back to STEP 1**

---

### STEP 3: Deploy Your Application

Once Docker is working, run these commands in PowerShell:

```bash
# Navigate to your project (if not already there)
cd "C:\Users\athua\OneDrive\Desktop\New fr"

# Deploy with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

**Wait for it to finish building and starting.**

---

### STEP 4: Check if It's Running

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs
```

You should see your container `pdf-merger-app` running.

---

### STEP 5: Access Your Application

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **http://localhost:3000**
3. You should see your PDF Merger Tool!

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

1. **Fix Docker** → Restart Docker Desktop or run `fix-docker.bat`
2. **Verify** → Run `docker ps` (should work without errors)
3. **Deploy** → Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. **Access** → Open `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 🛑 To Stop the Application

```bash
docker-compose down
```
