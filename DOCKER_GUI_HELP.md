# Docker Desktop GUI Not Opening - Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Good News: Docker is Working!

Your Docker daemon is running perfectly. Your containers are working. The issue is just the GUI window.

## Quick Solutions

### 1. Check System Tray
- Look at the bottom-right corner of your screen (system tray)
- Find the Docker whale icon 🐋
- **Right-click** on it → Select "Open Dashboard" or "Settings"

### 2. Open Docker Desktop Manually
- Press `Windows Key` → Type "Docker Desktop" → Press Enter
- Or double-click: `docker-open.bat` (in this folder)

### 3. Restart Docker Desktop
Run: `docker-restart.bat` (in this folder)

Or manually:
1. Right-click Docker icon in system tray → "Quit Docker Desktop"
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Start Docker Desktop from Start Menu

## You Don't Need the GUI!

Your application is running and accessible without the GUI:

### Access Your App
- **Browser**: http://localhost:3000
- **Command Line**: Use all the commands below

### Manage Containers via Command Line

```powershell
# View running containers
docker ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs

# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Start containers
docker-compose up -d

# View container stats
docker stats

# Access container shell
docker exec -it pdf-merger-app sh
```

## Fix Docker Desktop Window

### Method 1: Restart Docker Desktop Service
```powershell
# Stop Docker
taskkill /F /IM "Docker Desktop.exe"

# Wait a few seconds, then start it
start "" "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe"
```

### Method 2: Reset Docker Desktop
1. Open Docker Desktop (if possible)
2. Go to Settings (gear icon)
3. Click "Reset to factory defaults" (⚠️ This will delete all containers/images)

### Method 3: Reinstall Docker Desktop
1. Uninstall Docker Desktop from Control Panel
2. Download latest from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
3. Reinstall and restart

## Verify Docker is Working

Run these commands to verify:

```powershell
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Check if Docker daemon is running
docker info

# Check your containers
docker ps

# Test your application
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Current Status

✅ **Docker daemon**: Running  
✅ **Your container**: Running (pdf-merger-app)  
✅ **Application**: Accessible at http://localhost:3000  
❓ **GUI window**: May be minimized or hidden  

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Check Windows Updates**: Make sure Windows is up to date
2. **Check WSL2**: Docker Desktop requires WSL2
   ```powershell
   wsl --status
   ```
3. **Check System Requirements**: 
   - Windows 10/11 64-bit
   - WSL 2 enabled
   - Virtualization enabled in BIOS

## Alternative: Use Docker Without GUI

You can manage everything via command line:
- All `docker` commands work fine
- Your app is accessible in the browser
- No GUI needed for basic operations
